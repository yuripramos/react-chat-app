## :cloud: Installation

Makefiles aren't Windows friendly, if you have minGW64 and whole environment to run the makefile(Unix/macOS) do this:

```sh
make installation
make start
access http://localhost:8080/
```

If you **don't** have makefile enviroment ready, do this instead :

```sh

npm install or yarn install
npm run start
access http://localhost:8080/
```
